# Security Policy

Do not include BDUSS, STOKEN, complete cookies, device identifiers, or private
user content in issues, fixtures, logs, screenshots, or crash reports.

The networking layer must use HTTPS with URLSession's default certificate and
hostname verification. Any endpoint that requires disabled verification or a
global cleartext exception must remain unsupported.

API traffic is restricted to the exact HTTPS hosts `tiebac.baidu.com` and
`tieba.baidu.com`. Redirects between those hosts are rejected even though both
are individually allowed.

Remote media uses an ephemeral, credential-free session, rejects cleartext
requests or redirect destinations, and is decoded through ImageIO with a
bounded pixel size and memory cache. Original image dimensions are never
decoded directly into the browsing UI.

Report security issues privately to the repository owner rather than opening a
public issue.
