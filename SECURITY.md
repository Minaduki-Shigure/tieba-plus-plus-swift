# Security Policy

Do not include BDUSS, STOKEN, complete cookies, device identifiers, or private
user content in issues, fixtures, logs, screenshots, or crash reports.

The networking layer must use HTTPS with URLSession's default certificate and
hostname verification. Any endpoint that requires disabled verification or a
global cleartext exception must remain unsupported.

Report security issues privately to the repository owner rather than opening a
public issue.
